In our current work, we investigate how to create POStagging and dependency parsing experts for heterogeneous data by employingtopic modeling. We create topic models (using Latent Dirichlet Allocation) todetermine genres from a heterogeneous dataset and then train an expert for eachof the genres. Our results show that the topic modeling experts reachsubstantial improvements when compared to the general versions. For dependencyparsing, the improvement reaches 2 percent points over the full trainingbaseline when we use two topics.",
